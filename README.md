## 📁 Dataset
Contains labeled images of:
- Neutrophil
- Eosinophil
- Monocyte
- Lymphocyte

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run: `python main.py`

## 📈 Results
- Accuracy: ~96%  
- High precision & recall  
- Confusion matrix indicates strong classification ability
